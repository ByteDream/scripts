# scripts
This repository contains some (linux) scripts I am using to simplify my daily work (call it what you want), modify applications to make them look more estatic or just because I can and I have too much time.


### Overview

- [Change firefox icons](/firefox-icon-fix)
- [Merge pdf files together](/merge-pdf)
- [Rename files random](/randomize-filename)
- [Rename files based on their MD5 hashsum](/hashify-filename)
- [Beautify java source code](/java-beautifier)
- [Name availability check (websites & github)](/nameavability)

If you want to use any of the scripts globally, execute [globalize.sh](globalize.sh)
