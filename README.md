# scripts
This repository contains some (linux) scripts I am using to simplify my daily work (call it what you want), modify applications to make them look more estatic or just because I can and I have too much time.


### Overview

- [Change firefox icons](/firefox-icon-fix)
- [Github repository mirror](/github-webhook)
- [Merge pdf files together](merge-pdf)


If you want to use any of the (bash!) scripts globaly, see [pathify](/pathify)
